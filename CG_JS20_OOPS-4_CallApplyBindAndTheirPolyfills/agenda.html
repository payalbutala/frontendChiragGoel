            The term “polyfill” is a combination of “poly,” meaning many, and
            “fill,” indicating filling in the gaps. Polyfills are used to bring
            new or standardized features to older browsers or environments that
            do not inherently support those features.

          <li>
            When new JavaScript features are introduced or when web standards
            evolve, not all browsers immediately implement those changes. This
            can create a situation where developers want to use the latest
            language features or APIs but still need to support older browsers.
            In such cases, they can include polyfills to ensure that the
            required functionality is available across a broader range of
            browsers.
